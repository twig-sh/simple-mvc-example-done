       out any cats.

     recently added cat we want an empty query so that it can find all of the cats.

     The second parameter is the actual update. Usually this would just be an unnested
     object like {'bedsOwned': 1}. However this will set the cat's bedsowned to 1, not
     increase it. So instead we need to use the Mongo macro $inc as a key to another
     object. Essentially this says "everything defined in this subobject is an increment
     not a set". So {$inc: {'bedsOwned': 1}} says "increase the beds owned by 1".

     Finally, findOneAndUpdate would just update the most recent cat it finds that
     matches the query (which could be any cat). So we also need to tell Mongoose to
     sort all the cats in descending order by created date so that we update the
     most recently added one. The returnDocument key with the 'after' value tells
     mongoose to give us back the version of the document AFTER the changes. Otherwise
